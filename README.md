# Covenants

[![Check Set-Up & Build](https://github.com/timewave-computer/covenants/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/timewave-computer/covenants/actions/workflows/check.yml)

**Covenants are interchain agreements**. They allow IBC enabled parties to establish multilateral alliances. Examples of covenants:

* 🤝 token swap agreements between protocols
* 🤝 agreements for protocol-owned liquidity

Covenants are a modular system of contracts that can be deployed in various configurations. Timewave works closely with protocol representatives to design and configure covenants to suit their needs.

Our mainnet deployed contract code ids can be found on the [latest release](https://github.com/timewave-computer/covenants/releases/latest).

Covenants have been independently audited by Informal Systems and Oak Security:
