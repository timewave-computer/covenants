# Covenants 

[![Check Set-Up & Build](https://github.com/timewave-computer/covenants/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/timewave-computer/covenants/actions/workflows/check.yml)

**Covenants are interchain agreements**. They allow IBC enabled parties to establish multilateral alliances. Examples of covenants:

* 🤝 token swap agreements between protocols
* 🤝 agreements for protocol-owned liquidity
* 🤝 an agreement to give a governance seat to another DAO

Covenants are a modular system of contracts that can be deployed in various configurations. Timewave works closely with protocol representatives to design and configure covenants to suit their needs.

We are currently working on exciting new covenants. Our completed covenants include:
* 🛠️ [Stride LP covenant](./stride-covenant/)
