[![Check Set-Up & Build](https://github.com/timewave-computer/covenants/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/timewave-computer/covenants/actions/workflows/check.yml)

**Covenants are interchain agreements**. They allow IBC enabled parties to establish multilateral alliances. Examples of covenants:

* 🤝 token swap agreements between protocols
* 🤝 single-party agreements for protocol-owned liquidity
* 🤝 multi-party agreements for protocol-owned liquidity
* 🤝 an agreement to give a governance seat to another DAO

Covenants are a modular system of contracts that can be deployed in various configurations. Timewave works closely with protocol representatives to design and configure covenants to suit their needs.
